## Overview

This decentralized ride-sharing service eliminates intermediaries, empowering drivers and riders to connect directly through blockchain technology. By leveraging smart contracts, we provide a transparent, secure, and efficient transportation ecosystem with lower fees, enhanced privacy, and improved service quality.

### Mission
To create a fair, accessible, and community-owned transportation network where value flows directly between service providers and users.

## Architecture

The platform consists of interconnected smart contracts deployed on a public blockchain, a decentralized storage solution for user data, and user-friendly mobile applications.

### Core Components:
1. **Smart Contracts**: Solidity contracts managing all platform logic and transactions
2. **Decentralized Storage**: IPFS for storing user profiles, ratings, and non-sensitive ride data
3. **Mobile Applications**: iOS and Android apps for drivers and riders
4. **Oracles**: Integration with real-world data sources for location services, maps, and price feeds
5. **Identity Layer**: Decentralized identity verification system

## Smart Contracts

### 1. Driver Contract
Manages driver profiles, verification, ratings, and availability
- **Functions**:
    - `registerDriver(license, insurance, vehicle)`: Registers a new driver with required documentation
    - `updateAvailability(location, status)`: Updates driver's current location and availability
    - `updateRates(baseRate, perMile, perMinute)`: Sets custom pricing parameters
    - `getDriverProfile(address)`: Returns driver information and ratings
    - `withdrawEarnings()`: Transfers accumulated earnings to driver's wallet

### 2. Rider Contract
Handles rider profiles, ride history, and payment management
- **Functions**:
    - `registerRider(name, contact)`: Creates a new rider profile
    - `requestRide(pickup, destination, preferences)`: Initiates a new ride request
    - `cancelRideRequest(requestId)`: Cancels a pending ride request
    - `fundWallet(amount)`: Adds funds to rider's platform wallet
    - `getRideHistory(address)`: Returns past rides for a specific rider

### 3. Ride Contract
Manages individual rides from request to completion
- **Functions**:
    - `matchRide(requestId, driverId)`: Pairs a rider request with an available driver
    - `startRide(rideId)`: Begins the ride and locks payment in escrow
    - `updateLocation(rideId, location)`: Records ride progress for safety and transparency
    - `completeRide(rideId)`: Finalizes the ride, processes payment, and updates ratings
    - `calculateFare(distance, time, demand)`: Determines the ride cost based on multiple factors

### 4. Dispute Resolution Contract
Handles conflicts between drivers and riders through decentralized arbitration
- **Functions**:
    - `fileDispute(rideId, description, evidence)`: Initiates a dispute process
    - `assignArbitrators(disputeId)`: Randomly selects community arbitrators
    - `submitEvidence(disputeId, evidenceHash)`: Allows parties to submit supporting evidence
    - `resolveDispute(disputeId, decision)`: Finalizes the dispute and executes the resolution
    - `appealDecision(disputeId, reason)`: Allows for appeals in certain circumstances

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Ethereum-compatible wallet (MetaMask recommended)
- Smartphone with GPS capabilities
- Valid driver's license and insurance (for drivers)
- Basic understanding of cryptocurrency transactions

### Installation
1. Download the mobile application:
   ```
   [App Store Link for iOS]
   [Play Store Link for Android]
   ```

2. Create or import your wallet:
    - Create a new wallet through the app
    - Or import an existing wallet using your seed phrase

3. Complete verification:
    - Identity verification (KYC) for all users
    - Additional document verification for drivers

4. Fund your wallet:
    - Add native tokens for gas fees
    - Add stablecoins for ride payments

## Features

### For Drivers
- **Higher Earnings**: Lower platform fees compared to centralized services
- **Customizable Terms**: Set your own rates, working hours, and service area
- **Instant Payments**: Receive funds immediately after ride completion
- **Reputation System**: Build a verifiable driving history on the blockchain
- **Dispute Protection**: Fair arbitration system for conflict resolution

### For Riders
- **Lower Costs**: Reduced fees through peer-to-peer transactions
- **Enhanced Privacy**: Minimal data collection and no central database
- **Transparent Pricing**: Clear fare calculation without hidden fees
- **Safety Features**: Cryptographically secure identity verification
- **Choice**: Select drivers based on ratings, vehicle type, or custom preferences

## Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation (Q2-Q3 2025)
- Core smart contract development and auditing
- Basic mobile application with essential features
- Integration with mapping services
- Initial market testing in select cities

### Phase 2: Expansion (Q4 2025-Q1 2026)
- Advanced matching algorithm implementation
- Multi-language support
- Expanded payment options including more cryptocurrencies
- Launch in additional metropolitan areas

### Phase 3: Maturity (Q2-Q4 2026)
- Implementation of governance token and DAO
- Decentralized insurance pool
- AI-enhanced safety features
- Cross-chain interoperability

## Security Considerations

### Smart Contract Security
- All contracts undergo multiple professional audits
- Formal verification for critical functions
- Bug bounty program to incentivize vulnerability reporting

### User Security
- Multi-factor authentication for all accounts
- Real-time ride tracking shared with trusted contacts
- Emergency button with direct authority contact
- Escrow system for all payments

### Privacy Protection
- Minimal data collection (only what's necessary for service)
- Zero-knowledge proofs for sensitive information
- Encrypted communication channels
- Option for anonymous ratings
